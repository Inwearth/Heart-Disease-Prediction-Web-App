# Heart Disease Prediction Web App

The developed Machine Learning model made use of available Python based libraries and mathematical algorithms.

For linking the front-end part of our application with the model, we made use of the python-based framework Flask.

During the development process we found that KNN algorithm worked better and provided higher accuracy rate compared to Logistic Regression and hence was used in this model.
